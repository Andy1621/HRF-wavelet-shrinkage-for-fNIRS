Abstract: Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can measure hemodynamic signals, and the results are similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals. 
Thus, fNIRS can be employed to investigate brain activity by measuring the absorption of near infrared light through an intact skull. Recently, a general linear model (GLM), which is a standard method for fMRI imaging, was applied to fNIRS imaging analysis. 
However, the GLM fails when fNIRS signals retain noise, such as that caused by the subjectâ€™s movement during measurement. 
Although wavelet-based denoising and hemodynamic response function smoothing are popular denoising methods for fNIRS signals, these methods do not exhibit impressive performances for very noisy environments and a specific class of noise. 
Thus, this paper proposes a new denoising algorithm that uses multiple wavelet shrinkage and a multiple threshold function based on a hemodynamic response model. 
Through the experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified using graphic results and objective indexes, and it is compared with existing denoising algorithms.
